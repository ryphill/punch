punch-in
========

Keeps track of how much time you spend on a project.


How to implement
========
  * Have process running in the background
  * Utilize a log file that keeps start and end times
    * possibly allow user to specify which project to add time to
    * keep the time frames so a timeline can be created or truncate ranges into separate lengths of time?
